Description:
    Stubs out a new database migration for a specific use_db managed database.
    Pass the database_name, migration name - either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    A migration class is generated in the databases migration directory
    prefixed by a timestamp of the current date and time.

    You can name your migration in either of these formats to generate
    add/remove column lines from supplied attributes: AddColumnsToTable or
    RemoveColumnsFromTable

Example:
    Assuming there is a config/use_db.yml file with:
        my_subproject:
            prefix: my_subproject_
            db_dir: engines/my_subproject/db
            
    `./script/generate migration_for my_subproject AddSslFlag`

    If the current date is May 14, 2008 and the current time 09:09:12, this
    creates the AddSslFlag migration engines/my_subproject/db/migrate/20080514090912_add_ssl_flag.rb

    `./script/generate migration_for my_subproject AddTitleBodyToPost title:string body:text published:boolean`
    
    This will create the AddTitleBodyToPost in
    engines/my_subproject/db/migrate/20080514090912_add_title_body_to_post.rb 
    with this in the Up migration:

      add_column :posts, :title, :string  
      add_column :posts, :body, :text  
      add_column :posts, :published, :boolean

    And this in the Down migration:
    
      remove_column :posts, :published  
      remove_column :posts, :body  
      remove_column :posts, :title
